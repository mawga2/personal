tell me about a2a, agent to agent protocol. i understand that it is developed by Google and it follows a centralized peer-to-peer architecture. Agent card is retrieved via HTTP. it can be session-aware or clueless. its transport layer is centralized peer-to-peer. its strength is its inter-agent negotiation and its weakness being it assumes agent catalog. however, I copied all of that information from a picture and understand none of it. provide an overarching summary with context and elaboration. assume I have some degree of knowledge in agents.
